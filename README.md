<h1 align="center"> Hi 🤗, I'm Suat ORUÇ</h1>

<h3 align="center"> Full Stack Automation Tester </h3>

<p align="justify"> I am a human, an engineer, a new tester who stepped into the IT world, I am 40 years old and when I look back 10 years later, I want to have achieved good things in the IT world. </p>

<ul>
  <li><b> I am currently studying. We learned java, sql, selenium, and some html.</b> </li>
  <li>In my opinion, whenever a person says I don't need to learn anything new, then he/she starts to die,</li>
  <li>There is no age to learn and enjoy it. </li>
    </ul>
